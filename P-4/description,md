# Managing and Optimizing Amazon EBS Volumes

### Steps to Complete the Practical

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**  
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and launch an EC2 instance.
   - Select **Ubuntu** as the AMI and **t2.micro** as the instance type.

2. **Create and Attach an EBS Volume**  
   - Go to the EBS service and create a new volume (5GB, gp2).
   - Attach the volume to your EC2 instance.

3. **Partition and Mount the Volume**  
   - Connect to the instance using SSH.
   - Partition the volume:  
     `sudo fdisk /dev/xvdf`
   - Format the volume:  
     `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1`
   - Mount the volume:  
     `sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/volume`

4. **Create a Snapshot**  
   - Go to the EBS service and create a snapshot of the attached volume.

5. **Restore Volume from Snapshot**  
   - Use the snapshot to create a new volume.
   - Attach the new volume to the EC2 instance and verify the data.
